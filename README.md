# WEB-BASED UTILITY FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF CORN PLANT DISEASES USING PRE-TRAINED DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE

A thesis prototype project for IULI in determining a corn plant disease by the use of state-of-the-art architecture called EfficientNet. This repository is a sign of progression in developing the prototype before it will be released out into the open public for real world uses.

# Setup

    ```
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```
2. Execute Streamlit locally by inserting the following:
    ```
    $ streamlit run main.py
    ```
3. Head over to the given url link or let the execution of streamlit open them for you on a new browser tab:
